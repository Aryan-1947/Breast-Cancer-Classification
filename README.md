# Breast Cancer Classification

## 📌 Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify breast tumors as benign or malignant using numerical features from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast mass. Each sample has 30 numerical features including radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.

## 🧠 Workflow Overview
1. Data loading and inspection  
2. Handling missing values and preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis  
4. Model training with multiple algorithms  
5. Model evaluation and comparison  
6. Final model selection

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📈 Results and Interpretation
The Support Vector Machine model performed the best with an accuracy of ~97%. The model is reliable for predicting tumor types based on feature patterns from the dataset.
